# Extension Icons

## How to Create Real Icons

For now, the extension will work with placeholder icons. To create proper icons:

### Option 1: Use an Online Icon Generator
1. Visit: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload a logo or image (related to job tracking)
3. Download the generated icons
4. Replace the files in this folder

### Option 2: Use Design Tools
1. Create icons in Figma, Canva, or Photoshop
2. Export as PNG with these sizes:
   - icon-16.png (16x16)
   - icon-32.png (32x32)
   - icon-48.png (48x48)
   - icon-128.png (128x128)
3. Save them in this folder

### Design Suggestions
- Use a briefcase icon ðŸ“‹
- Use UK flag colors (red, white, blue)
- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Make it professional

### Temporary Solution
The extension will work without proper icons. Chrome will show a default icon placeholder.
